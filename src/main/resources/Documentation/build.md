Build
=====

This plugin is built with Bazel and two build modes are supported:

* Standalone
* In Gerrit tree.

Standalone build mode is recommended, as this mode doesn't require local Gerrit
tree to exist.

## Build standalone

To build the plugin, issue the following command:

```
  bazel build @PLUGIN@.jar
```

The output is created in

```
  bazel-genfiles/@PLUGIN@.jar
```

To package the plugin sources run:

```
  bazel build lib@PLUGIN@__plugin-src.jar
```

The output is created in:

```
  bazel-bin/lib@PLUGIN@__plugin-src.jar
```

To execute the tests run:

```
  bazel test @PLUGIN@_tests
```

This project can be imported into the Eclipse IDE:

```
  ./tools/eclipse/project.sh
```

## Build in Gerrit tree

Clone or link this plugin to the plugins directory of Gerrit's
source tree. Put the external dependency Bazel build file into
the Gerrit /plugins directory, replacing the existing empty one.

```
  cd gerrit/plugins
  rm external_plugin_deps.bzl
  ln -s javamelody/external_plugin_deps.bzl .
```

Then issue

```
  bazel build plugins/javamelody:javamelody
```

To execute the tests run:

```
  bazel test plugins/@PLUGIN@:@PLUGIN@_tests
```

This project can be imported into the Eclipse IDE.
Add the plugin name to the `CUSTOM_PLUGINS` and to the
`CUSTOM_PLUGINS_TEST_DEPS` set in Gerrit core in
`tools/bzl/plugins.bzl`, and execute:

```
  ./tools/eclipse/project.py
```

More information about Bazel can be found in the [Gerrit
documentation](../../../Documentation/dev-bazel.html).
