      "message": "You are right. I\u0027m very sorry for breaking the build. Being undiscovered for months even sucks more. However, I can eplxain you how this was possible: There is one really annoying bug in Buck: [1] in combination with using watchman (I do use watchman) and symbolic links. Buck ignores the changes in this case. So the only explanation i have, why the build was broken and change owner and reviewer of original change havn\u0027t discovered that is:\n\n* build in tree base version\n* introduce standalone build\n* break in tree build\n* test standalone build, correct\n* test broken in tree, still (erroneously) correct, because of : [1]\n\nSo again, I\u0027m sorry, but let\u0027s blame Buck for that and not the change owner and (never) the reviewer ;-)\n\n* [1] https://github.com/facebook/buck/issues/341",
