I think we should have buckets as submodule so that it can always point to the *correct* version of it.\n\nIf you follow the instructions TODAY for building a JavaMelody plugin for Gerrit 2.11 ... would it work? Don\u0027t think so :-(\n\nI had to \"find out by myself\" the correct SHA1 for buckets and check that version out. By using submodules we would avoid this manual step.",
