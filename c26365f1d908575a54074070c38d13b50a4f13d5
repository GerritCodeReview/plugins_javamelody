      "message": "Sorry, but this is wrong fix. We are not duplicating gerrit tree in plugin directory for standalone build mode to work. Instead, we defining constants in this file: bucklets/gerrit_plugin.bucklet where to find the constants in tree and standalone modes. Here is in tree version:\n\n  #\n  # Dummy to make the co-existence of core and standalone plugins possible.\n  # Intentionaly left empty as this doesn\u0027t suppose to have any side effects\n  # in tree build, i. e.:\n  #\n  # cookbook-plugin/BUCK include this line:\n  # include_defs(\u0027//bucklets/gerrit_plugin.bucklet\u0027)\n  #\n  # When executing from the Gerrit tree:\n  # buck build plugins/cookbook-plugin\n  #\n  # this line has no effect.\n  #\n  # When compiling from standalone cookbook-plugin, bucklets directory points\n  # to cloned bucklets library that includes real gerrit_plugin.bucklet code.\n  GERRIT_GWT_API \u003d [\u0027//gerrit-plugin-gwtui/gerrit:gwtui-api\u0027]\n  GERRIT_PLUGIN_API \u003d [\u0027//gerrit-plugin-api:lib\u0027]\n  GERRIT_TESTS \u003d [\u0027//gerrit-acceptance-framework:lib\u0027]\n  STANDALONE_MODE \u003d False\n\nAnd in bucklets we have another version that routes all constants to lib/gerrit:foo",
